# uPortal Documentation Strategy

uPortal has a long history that predates GitHub and other *now* common services and related best practices.
As such our documentation approach has shifted organically.
Here we are capturing our current approach to documentation.

## Documentation Goal
Our goal is to centralized uPortal documentation for the core service here in this repo under the `manual` folder.
In this folder we capture the latest documentation for a major release of uPortal.
Minor release differences will be noted in the manual as appropriate.
We continue with the historical sections of our manual that target an audience, such as deployer, admin, and developer.

Portlet repos contain their own documentation; however, the uPortal manuals may reference and even include some documentation for portlets.
That said, any portlet specific information in these manuals should also be present in the portlet repos.

## Remaining Work
Besides the typical challenge of documenting an open source project, uPortal has additional challenges.
Our uPortal 4 manual is in Confluence, and our uPortal 5 documentation has been captured
in both the uPortal 5 repo and the uPortal-start repo.

*We welcome any assistance in migrating documentation from those sources to this repo.*
