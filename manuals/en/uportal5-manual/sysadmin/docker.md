# Docker

## Benefits of Docker with uPortal

-   Includes all dependencies and tooling out of the box
-   Capture known OS flavor and version
-   JDK version explicitly rolled into image
-   Transient dependencies locked
-   Images are files that can be managed by Ops for updates/rollbacks
    -   Images are only about 1Gb
-   Images are portable!!

## uPortal Docker Tasks

-   dockerBuildImageCli
    -   Builds the Docker image used to invoke Import/Export tasks from within a container
    -   Copies in several files / directories from uPortal-start
-   dockerBuildImageDemo
    -   Builds the uPortal Demo Docker image
    -   Runs hsqlStart and dataInit on startup
-   dockerBuildImageWeb
    -   Builds the basic web server-only Docker image
    -   Only captures Tomcat, uPortal and portlet webapps
-   dockerBuildImages
    -   All-in-one Gradle task for building all the Docker image
    -   Takes about 20 minutes on my laptop to build all 3 images

## Building and Running uPortal Demo

Here are the steps to setup uPortal Demo as a Docker image and then run it as a container.

### Prerequisites

-   Docker installed for non-admin users
-   Java 8 JDK installed and configured (e.g. JAVA_HOME set)
-   uPortal-start repository present

### Steps

-   Build and run uPortal to confirm it works as expected
-   Stop HSQL and Tomcat, if they are running
-   Create the Docker images from the repo
    -   `$ ./gradlew dockerBuildImageCli dockerBuildImageDemo`
-   Confirm that the images were created in Docker
    -   `$ docker images`
-   Run the image as a container with shell access
    -   `$ docker run -it -p 8080:8080 apereo/uportal-demo`
-   Wait for the container to finish starting up Tomcat
-   Point your browser at `http://localhost:8080/uPortal`

## Using Docker in Deployments

### Prerequisites for Servers

-   Docker installed for non-admin users
-   Java 8 JDK installed and configured (e.g. JAVA_HOME set)
-   uPortal user (e.g. `portal` and home directory (e.g. `/opt/uportal`) set up
-   Have a naming convention for uPortal images
    -   Example uses "uportal" - "uPortal version" - "local revision"
    -   Developers should tag commits to mark deployments

### Build uPortal Images

-   Build server set up to build uPortal
    -   Does not have to be a dedicated server
-   Repository to capture versions of your local docker images
    -   This is often an Ops system rather than Git
-   Build uPortal Web image
    -   `$ ./gradlew dockerBuildImageWeb`
-   Export uPortal Web image
    -   `$ docker save -o uportal-v5.7.0-01.image apereo/uportal`
-   Save image file to repository
-   Copy image to servers, preferable to uPortal user home directory

### Setup on Servers

-   Create a log directory
    -   `$ sudo mkdir /opt/uportal/logs`
    -   `$ sudo chown portal /opt/uportal/logs`
-   Create a configuration directory
    -   `$ sudo mkdir /opt/uportal/portal`
    -   `$ sudo chown portal /opt/uportal/portal`
-   Copy/update configuration files for local server
    -   This is usually also managed with an Ops system
    -   At minimum, should have:
        -   `/opt/uportal/portal/global.properties`
        -   `/opt/uportal/portal/uPortal.properties`

### Run uPortal Image on Servers

-   Import Docker Image
    -   `$ docker load -i uportal-v5.7.0-01.image`
-   Run uPortal Docker Image
    -   `$ docker run --name uportal-v5.7.0-01 -d -v /opt/uportal/logs:/tomcat/logs -v /opt/uportal/portal:/tomcat/portal -p 8080:8080 -p 7800:7800 apereo/uportal`
-   Confirm that logs are updating
    -   `$ ls -rtl /opt/uportal/logs`

### Additional Ports

Each institution and maybe even cluster may need additional port mappings.
Remember port mappings are only required to allow external traffic reach the docker container.
Calls from inside the container to external services, such as databases, do not require mappings.

Here are some ports be aware of, including the defaults:

-   8080 - default port for HTTP traffic
-   7800 - JGroups port for sharing some caches

-   8009 - default AJP port for Apache/IIS when using this protocol
    -   Apache/IIS can be configured to use either HTTP or AJP protocols
-   8005 - Tomcat shutdown port
-   8443 - default HTTPS port

Another potential set of ports to add would be for monitoring, such as JMX/JRE connections.

## Known Issues

-   Demo image is broken when using a custom skin
    -   This does not affect Web images as they already contain binaries, rather than build from source
-   Running the docker tasks to create images while HSQL is running breaks HSQL in container
    -   The lock files are copied when HSQL is running, causing a lock issue in the container
-   On Linux, using Docker with pipes does not work
    -   Reconfigure Docker to use ports

## Alternatives to Docker

If Docker is not a technology of interest, there are alternatives that uPortal-start supports. uPortal-start has two gradle tasks that archive and compress Tomcat with all the uPortal and portlets apps deployed.

-   `./gradlew tomcatTar`
    -   Creates `tomcat-uportal.tgz`
-   `./gradlew tomcatZip`
    -   Creates `tomcat-uportal.zip`
