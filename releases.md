# uPortal Releases

Here we capture details about uPortal releases.

## Versioning

We follow the Semantic Versioning as defined at [https://semver.org/]() for uPortal.

## Frequency

### Major Releases

Major releases are created every 3 to 5 years. We have determined that adopters do not have capacity for major releases
more often than every couple of years, so we target about 3 years between major releases and as major features warrant.
Major releases are defined by breaking changes that are not backyards compatible, thus takes more care to roll out.

### Minor Releases

We would like to push minor releases out at least quarterly. As minor releases are backwards compatible, we expect a high
frequency will not be an issue for adoption.

### Patch Releases

Patch releases should be cut based on the significance of the issues resolved since the last release. We place no limit
on patch releases as the changes should require no changes by implementers.
