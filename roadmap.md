# uPortal Roadmap

Here we capture our uPortal community roadmap as it emerges for a given year. This roadmap extends beyond the uPortal core project.
It includes the many sponsored sub-projects, such as portlets, web components and other supporting code bases.

## Roadmap Goal

The purpose of capturing our roadmap is to align development efforts with features and changes desired by implementers.

These features and changes come from the uPortal mailing lists and other stakeholders. Another important source is the group of active committers.

Ultimately, we wish to fulfill the purpose of uPortal to deliver a highly-personalized experience of navigating the university. And, we wish to increase adoption of uPortal at other institutions.

## Curating Roadmap Milestones

Our informal process of curating what ends up on the roadmap centers around our mailing lists and a roadmap discussion held
during the annual Open Apereo conference. These are usually brainstorming affairs. The threshold to be added to the roadmap
is rather low; however, realizing a milestone requires commitment and effort from someone. Thus, the additional challenge
for a propose roadmap milestone is finding someone willing and able to deliver it. The roadmap helps to align committers to desired features.

We can categorize milestones into the following categories.

### Differentiating

These milestones relate to how uPortal is different than other portals and supersedes competing solutions.

### Integration

Integration is critical to a portal to the point of having separate category. Integration includes connectivity
to back-end services and also APIs.

### Parity

This is the third category that captures changes that capture work that simply keeps uPortal current and relevant.

### Dropped

Some suggestions may not align with our current strategy or may not be included for other reasons.
A dropped feature / change may have merit, but the community may not want to plan to work on it in the next year.
